## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **`Chuvadi.Pdf.Reader` module** — a high-level facade over the
  library, designed for interactive PDF reader applications (Blazor
  WebAssembly, WPF, etc.) that want a small, mockable surface area
  instead of wiring the lower-level modules (Documents, Rendering,
  Svg, Text) directly
  - `IPdfReader` interface with six async methods: `OpenAsync`
    (stream + optional password), `RenderPageSvgAsync` (page-sized
    SVG with selectable text layer at native PDF coordinates),
    `RenderThumbnailAsync` (lower-precision SVG for thumbnail strips),
    `GetOutlinesAsync` (bookmark tree), `SearchAsync` (streaming
    `IAsyncEnumerable<SearchMatch>` across pages), and
    `GetTextRunsAsync` (per-page text-run geometry for selection
    layers)
  - `ChuvadiPdfReader` concrete implementation backed by the
    underlying library — `PdfDocument.OpenAsync`,
    `SvgRenderer.RenderPage`, `OutlineReader.GetOutlines`,
    `PdfDocument.SearchAsync`, `PdfDocument.GetTextRuns`. All public
    method parameters are validated with `ArgumentNullException` and
    `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`. Stateless and thread-safe; suitable
    for singleton registration in DI
  - Caches two `SvgRenderer` instances internally — one tuned for
    full-page rendering (`Precision = 4`, web-font embedding,
    selectable text), one for thumbnails (`Precision = 2`, CSS
    fallback fonts, selectable text). Visual sizing is the caller's
    responsibility per design: SVG is resolution-independent and
    browsers scale it losslessly via CSS

### Tests
- New `Chuvadi.Pdf.Reader.Tests` project with tests for every
  `IPdfReader` method covering: null-argument validation,
  out-of-range page indices, cancellation propagation, plain and
  encrypted-PDF open flows, render-output sanity (well-formed SVG),
  outline traversal on a document with no outline, search on a
  document with no text, and text-run extraction on an empty page

### Notes
- The module re-uses existing library types directly: `PdfDocument`,
  `OutlineItem` (in `Chuvadi.Pdf.Forms`), `SearchMatch`/`SearchOptions`/
  `TextRun` (in `Chuvadi.Pdf.Rendering.DisplayList`). Reader-app
  consumers add the corresponding `using` directives rather than
  going through a re-export layer — the types live where they
  logically belong, the facade just exposes them through a single
  small interface
- No breaking changes. Existing API surface is unchanged

---

## [2.0.2] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- **`EncryptionOptions` default permission mask** — `EncryptionOptions`
  constructed via the `Aes128` or `Aes256` factories was defaulting
  `Permissions` to `-3904` under the mistaken belief that the value
  meant "allow everything (PDF spec all-bits-on)". In fact `-3904`
  (`0xFFFFF0C0`) has **every** PDF 32000-1 §7.6.3.2 Table 22 permission
  bit CLEAR — print, modify, copy, annotate, fill-forms, accessibility
  extract, assemble, and high-quality print are all denied. The
  correct "allow everything" value is `-4` (`0xFFFFFFFC`): all eight
  permission bits set, both reserved-must-be-1 bits set, and all high
  reserved bits set. Encrypted PDFs written with default
  `EncryptionOptions` in v1.4.0 through v2.0.1 are maximally
  restricted regardless of intent
- Introduced `public const int EncryptionOptions.AllPermissionsAllowed = -4;`
  as a self-documenting reference value for the canonical "allow
  everything" mask, replacing the magic-number literal in the default
  constructor and the misleading doc comment. Callers who want to
  restrict specific permissions can continue to assign directly to
  the `Permissions` init property

### Tests
- New `EncryptionDefaultsRoundTripTests` under
  `tests/Chuvadi.Pdf.Documents.Tests` covering the AES-128 and AES-256
  write → read round-trip with default options, verifying that the
  read-back `PdfDocument.Encryption.Permissions` equals
  `EncryptionOptions.AllPermissionsAllowed` and that every `Allow*`
  decoder reports true. A guard test pins the constant to `-4` so any
  future regression to `-3904` is the loudest possible alarm
- Existing `EncryptionInfoTests.Constructor_PropertiesPropagate`
  updated to use `-4` as its sample permission value for consistency
  with the new constant; behaviour and assertions otherwise unchanged

### Notes
- The reader-side default for an absent `/P` entry in
  `EncryptionDictionary.Parse` (also `-3904`) is **intentionally not
  changed**. PDF spec requires `/P` to be present on encrypted
  documents; if a malformed document omits it, defaulting to all-bits-
  clear (deny by default) is the safer behaviour than auto-granting
  every permission
- The bug only affected the **default** permission value. Callers who
  passed an explicit `Permissions` value via the init property
  (e.g. `EncryptionOptions.Aes256("pw") with { Permissions = ... }`)
  were unaffected

---

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Document metadata properties** on `PdfDocument` for the date and
  trapping fields declared by PDF 32000-1 §14.3.3 — `CreationDate` and
  `ModDate` returning `DateTimeOffset?` parsed per §7.9.4 (UTC, offset,
  and date-only forms all supported; malformed inputs return null);
  `Trapped` returning `string?` and leniently accepting both `/Name`
  and `/String` forms (some producers write either); `XmpMetadata`
  returning the raw bytes of the Catalog's `/Metadata` stream
- **Encryption introspection** on `PdfDocument` via the new
  `Encryption` property returning `EncryptionInfo?` — null when the
  document is unencrypted, otherwise exposing `Algorithm`, `KeyLength`,
  `Revision`, `Version`, `Permissions`, `EncryptMetadata`, and eight
  permission decoders (`AllowPrint`, `AllowModify`, `AllowCopy`,
  `AllowAnnotate`, `AllowFillForms`, `AllowAccessibilityExtract`,
  `AllowAssemble`, `AllowPrintHighQuality`) per Table 22
- **Shape annotations — read and write** (PDF 32000-1 §12.5.6.7–9)
  - Five new public sealed classes derived from `PdfAnnotation`:
    `SquareAnnotation`, `CircleAnnotation`, `LineAnnotation`,
    `PolygonAnnotation`, `PolyLineAnnotation`
  - New shared `BorderStyle` class plus `BorderStyleType` enum
    (`Solid`/`Dashed`/`Beveled`/`Inset`/`Underline`) for the PDF
    `/BS` border-style dictionary
  - New `LineEnding` enum with all ten spec values
    (`None`/`Square`/`Circle`/`Diamond`/`OpenArrow`/`ClosedArrow`/
    `Butt`/`ROpenArrow`/`RClosedArrow`/`Slash`) for `/LE` on
    `LineAnnotation` and `PolyLineAnnotation`
  - `AnnotationType` enum extended with `Square`, `Circle`, `Line`,
    `Polygon`, `PolyLine`
  - `AnnotationReader` extended with five new subtype parsers plus
    helpers for `/BS`, `/LE`, and `/Vertices`; `ReadColor` refactored
    to take a key parameter so `/IC` (interior color) reuses the
    same code path as `/C` (border color)
  - `AnnotationWriter` extended with five new dictionary builders
    plus serializers for `BorderStyle`, line endings, line points,
    and vertices

### Tests
- 19 new tests under `tests/Chuvadi.Pdf.Documents.Tests` covering
  metadata properties (date parsing across UTC/offset/date-only/malformed
  inputs, name-vs-string Trapped variants, XMP round-trip,
  Encryption-null-when-unencrypted) and the `EncryptionInfo`
  permission decoders (per-bit theory, default deny, default allow)
- 17 new tests under `tests/Chuvadi.Pdf.Annotations.Tests` covering
  `BorderStyle` validation, shape model constructors, and full
  round-trip via `AnnotationWriter.Add` → `AnnotationReader.GetAnnotations`
  for all five shape subtypes
- Library total: 952 tests passing on the v2.0.1 commit

---

## [1.10.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Parser fuzz harness** (`tests/Chuvadi.Pdf.Fuzz/`) — hand-rolled mutation
  fuzzer with three targets: `pdf-open` (full document open), `content-stream`
  (content stream parsing), `truetype` (font loading). No NuGet dependencies.
  Mutations include splice, bit-flip, byte replace/insert/delete, boundary-value
  injection, range duplication, and random truncation. Crash inputs are saved
  to `crashes/<target>/<sha256>.bin` with full stack traces in matching `.txt`
  files for triage. See `tests/Chuvadi.Pdf.Fuzz/README.md`
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml` for scheduled fuzz runs
- `tests/Chuvadi.Pdf.Fuzz/FOLLOW-UPS.md` documenting findings deferred to
  PR 2.1 (truetype IndexOutOfRangeException bounds, PdfName.Intern
  ArgumentException tightening)

### Fixed
- `PdfPageCollection.FindPage` no longer recurses without bound on malformed
  page trees. Cyclic `/Kids` references and pathologically deep `/Pages`
  chains now throw `PdfDocumentException` with a clear message instead of
  killing the process with a `StackOverflowException`. Surfaced by the
  `pdf-open` fuzz target. Depth limit: 1024 (real PDFs use depth 1–5)
- `PdfObjectParser` no longer leaks `OverflowException` or `FormatException`
  from `int.Parse` on malformed integer tokens. All six parse sites now go
  through a guarded `ParseInt32` helper that throws `PdfReaderException` with
  the offending token's text snippet and byte offset. Surfaced by the
  `pdf-open` fuzz target after ~5.7M iterations

---

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- `benchmarks/Chuvadi.Benchmarks` project (BenchmarkDotNet harness)
  - `BrotliRatioBench`: output-size comparison vs `System.IO.Compression.BrotliStream`
    Optimal and Fastest across 6 representative scenarios (Lorem ipsum, English prose,
    repetitive, moderate, SFNT-like binary, random incompressible)
  - `BrotliThroughputBench`: encode-time comparison on the same scenarios
  - `ParserOpenBench`: `PdfDocument.Open` timing on synthetic single-page and 20-page PDFs
- `tests/Chuvadi.Pdf.Fonts.Woff2.Tests/BrotliLz77Tests.cs` — 11 regression tests covering
  the multi-command emission path

### Changed
- `BrotliCompressedEmitter` rewritten to consume the LZ77 command stream from
  `BrotliCommandStream.Encode()` and emit one Brotli command per LZ77 record. Per-block
  cap raised from 64 KiB to 16 MiB (MNIBBLES=6); inputs larger than that split across
  multiple meta-blocks
- `BrotliCompressedEmitter.TryEmit` (bool fallback) replaced by `Emit` (void, infallible
  for non-empty inputs)
- `BrotliEncoder` simplified — speculative compressed + stored, smaller wins
- Compression ratio on real data improved from 50-100% (single-command stage 3) to 2-6%
  (within ~1% of `BrotliStream` Optimal)

---

## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- RFC 7932 §3.5 "modify rule" violation in `BrotliComplexPrefixCode.RunLengthEncode`:
  consecutive 17 (or 16) codes caused exponential count blowup per the spec's modify
  formula, producing invalid streams. Fixed by inserting a literal-length entry between
  consecutive 17s and 16s to break the run

### Changed
- `BrotliCompressedEmitter` now wires complex prefix codes for inputs with 5+ distinct
  literals (previously fell back to stored meta-blocks)
- `BrotliHuffman.BuildCanonicalCodes` uses explicit `int[] ordered` instead of `var`
  (IDE0008 conformance)
- `BrotliCodeTables.cs` switch-expression arms split one-per-line for `dotnet format`
  conformance

### Added
- `tests/Chuvadi.Pdf.Fonts.Woff2.Tests` — first test project for the WOFF2 module, with
  11 regression tests covering the modify-rule fix across 5..25 distinct literals,
  random data, and repeated text

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Phase 1.1.4** — Digital signature verification (`Chuvadi.Pdf.Signatures`)
  - PKCS#7 / CMS detached signature parsing (PDF 32000-1 §12.8.3.3)
  - Certificate chain extraction and signing-time recovery
  - Byte-range verification against the signed bytes of the document
  - Verification-only in this release; signing remains on the backlog

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Phase 1.1.6** — Linearization / Fast Web View (ISO 32000-1 Annex F)
  - Reader detects linearization and exposes the `/Linearized` parameter
    dictionary through `PdfDocument.IsLinearized` / `PdfDocument.Linearization`
  - Writer produces linearized PDFs with primary hint stream via
    `PdfWriter.WriteLinearized(...)`
  - `BitWriter` / `BitReader` and `PageHintTable` infrastructure for
    sub-byte hint encoding

### Notes
- Spec-conformant output. Real-world viewer compatibility (Acrobat,
  Foxit, browser PDF viewers) is not yet verified end-to-end and is
  tracked in the backlog

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Phase 1.1.3** — Form XObject and image redaction. `Redactor` now
  traces the `Do` operator with full CTM intersection so any Form XObject
  or image overlapping a redaction rect is dropped from the rewritten
  content stream
- **Phase 1.1.7** — Optional content (layers) reader. `OptionalContentReader`
  + `OptionalContentGroup` expose `/OCProperties`, `/OCGs`, default
  configuration name, and resolved visibility (`/ON`, `/OFF`, `BaseState`)
- **Phase 1.1.8** — CMYK render output. `PageRasterizer` and `TiffEncoder`
  support CMYK pixel buffers (TIFF photometric=5)

### Fixed
- `Redactor` was silently corrupting name operands (`Tf`, `cs`, `gs`, `Do`)
  in the rewritten content stream. Regression test added

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Encryption fully wired into the public API:**
  - `PdfDocument.Open(stream, password)` for opening encrypted documents
  - `PdfWriter.Write(..., EncryptionOptions)` for writing encrypted documents
  - `EncryptionOptions` factory methods for AES-128 and AES-256 with owner
    and user passwords
  - `EncryptionVisitor` traverses the object graph and encrypts strings and
    streams in place during write
  - `EncryptionDictionaryBuilder` implements PDF Algorithms 3/5 (R=4,
    standard security handler) and ISO 32000-2 Algorithms 8/9 (R=6,
    AES-256)
- 5 integration tests including byte-level plaintext-absence verification
  on round-tripped encrypted documents

### Changed
- AES-128 and AES-256 are now supported for both read AND write paths
  (v1.3.0 shipped read-only)

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Phase 1.1.2** — Pattern-based redaction (`Chuvadi.Pdf.Redaction`)
  - `PatternRule` and `PatternMatcher` for regex-based content matching
  - `CommonPatterns` library covering SSN, email, phone, ICD-10, NHS
    number, and other common PHI identifiers
- **Phase 1.1.9** — TIFF baseline 6.0 read and write
  (`Chuvadi.Pdf.Images.TiffDecoder` / `TiffEncoder`)
  - Uncompressed, PackBits, and LZW compression
  - Multi-page TIFFs via chained IFDs
- **Phase 1.1.5** — Standard security handler encryption (read path)
  (`Chuvadi.Pdf.Encryption`, `Chuvadi.Cryptography`)
  - RC4-40 and RC4-128 decryption
  - AES-128 decryption
  - Password-based key derivation per Algorithm 2

### Notes
- 604 tests across 19 test projects at tag time
- Write path for encryption arrived in v1.4.0

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- 8 runnable example projects under `examples/` (TextExtraction,
  Watermark, Redaction, Render, FormFill, Outlines, PageOps,
  Annotations)
- Getting Started guide (`docs/getting-started.md`)
- **Auto-generated Markdown API reference** (`docs/api/`, 117 pages)
  produced by `tools/gen_api_docs.py` parsing XML doc comments from
  every public type across all `src/` modules

### Changed
- CI adds a `docs-up-to-date` job that re-runs `gen_api_docs.py` and
  fails the PR if the resulting Markdown diverges from what's committed
- Style check (`tools/check_style.py`) expanded to scan `examples/`
  alongside `src/` and `tests/`

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Phase 1.1.1** — `Chuvadi.Pdf.Annotations` module (read and write
  per PDF 32000-1 §12.5)
  - `AnnotationReader` and `AnnotationWriter` covering Text, FreeText,
    Link, Stamp, Ink, Markup, and Generic annotation types
- GitHub Actions CI matrix: style check + build/test on Ubuntu,
  Windows, and macOS
- Style checker (`tools/check_style.py`) with line-by-line string
  stripping, `CONFLICT_OVERRIDES`, and `bin/` / `obj/` exclusion

### Fixed
- `Chuvadi.Pdf.Text.csproj` was missing several `ProjectReference`
  entries; added
- 10 `var`-in-`src` violations rewritten with explicit types to satisfy
  the IDE0008 rule that the new style checker now enforces

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- Initial public release. Closes Phase 2 (rendering, watermarking,
  redaction, forms, CLI). 17 modules, ~564 tests, 0 failures
- **Read pipeline:** PDF 1.4–2.0 ingestion (classic and stream xref,
  including hybrid); all standard non-encryption filters (Flate,
  ASCIIHex, ASCII85, RunLength, LZW); Type1 standard 14 fonts, TrueType,
  and CFF/Type1C inspection; full content stream tokenizer and parser
- **Text extraction:** operator-walking, layout-aware, and glyph-level
  fallback strategies (the glyph extractor handles non-Latin scripts via
  TrueType outline extraction)
- **Rendering:** zero-dependency scanline rasterizer producing PNG and
  BMP output; standard PDF fonts (Helvetica, Times, Courier) plus
  embedded TrueType; adaptive Bezier flattening; both fill rules;
  butt/square stroke caps
- **Document operations:** merge, split, delete pages, rotate, extract
  page ranges; text watermarks with rotation, opacity, and per-page
  targeting; image watermarks via PNG XObject embedding
- **PHI-safe redaction:** rectangle-based content-stream rewriting with
  byte-level removal (the redacted text is absent from the output PDF
  at both operator and indirect-object levels). Conservative TJ array
  drop. Tests grep the output bytes to verify removal
- **AcroForms:** read the field tree (fully-qualified names, types,
  current values, object IDs); fill values, set button `/AS`, mark
  `/NeedAppearances=true`
- **Outlines (bookmarks):** read the full tree with children and
  resolve destinations to page indices
- **CLI** (`chuvadi`): 11 user verbs (info, render, watermark, redact,
  form-fill, extract-text, outlines, merge, split, delete, rotate) plus
  6 debug verbs (tokenize, dump-objects, parse-content, decode-stream,
  inspect-xref, validate-fonts)
- Project scaffolding for all 17 Phase 1 modules, Apache 2.0 license,
  initial CI/CD pipelines
