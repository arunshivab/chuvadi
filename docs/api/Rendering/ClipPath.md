# ClipPath

**Struct** in `Chuvadi.Pdf.Rendering.DisplayList` (Rendering)

A clipping path applied to a single render operation.

```csharp
public struct ClipPath
```

## Remarks

Chuvadi's display list represents clipping as per-operation data rather than as a paired Push/Pop on the renderer's state stack. Each `RenderOp` carries the list of clip paths active at the moment the op was emitted by the builder. A point is painted only when it lies inside every clip path in the list (intersection semantics).  

 This model has two advantages over a stack-of-pushes alternative: the display list cannot end up in an inconsistent state from malformed content streams, and consumers (rasterizer, SVG writer) handle clipping uniformly without tracking nested clip state across ops.

## Constructors

### `ClipPath(Path path, FillRule rule)`

Initialises a `ClipPath` with a path and a fill rule.

**Parameters**

- `path` — The clip path geometry in PDF user space.
- `rule` — The fill rule used to evaluate the clip region. <exception cref="ArgumentNullException"> Thrown when `path` is null. </exception>

## Properties

### `Path`

```csharp
Path Path
```

Gets the clip path geometry in PDF user space.

### `Rule`

```csharp
FillRule Rule
```

Gets the fill rule used to evaluate the clip region.
