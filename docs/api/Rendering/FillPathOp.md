# FillPathOp

**Class** in `Chuvadi.Pdf.Rendering.DisplayList` (Rendering)

Fills a path with a flat colour, applying the configured fill rule.

```csharp
public sealed class FillPathOp : RenderOp
```

## Remarks

Emitted by the builder for the PDF path-painting operators f / F / f* (fill only) and the fill portion of B / B* / b / b* (fill-then-stroke operators emit a `FillPathOp` followed by a `StrokePathOp` sharing the same path data).  

 The path is in PDF user space with the current transformation matrix already applied.
