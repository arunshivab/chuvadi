# DocumentSearch

**Class** in `Chuvadi.Pdf.Rendering.DisplayList` (Rendering)

Searches the text of a `PdfDocument` by page, streaming matches asynchronously.

```csharp
public static class DocumentSearch
```

## Remarks

Builds on `PdfPageExtensions.GetTextRuns`. Concatenates the page's text runs in reading order, performs a sliding-window string search, and emits matches as they're found. Cancellation is checked between pages and between matches.
