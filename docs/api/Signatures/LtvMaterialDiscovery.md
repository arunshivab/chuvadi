# LtvMaterialDiscovery

**Class** in `Chuvadi.Pdf.Signatures.Signing` (Signatures)

Walks a certificate chain and fetches the validation material (CRLs, OCSP responses) advertised by each certificate's extensions. Used to populate `LtvOptions` without making the caller wire up HTTP fetches by hand.

```csharp
public static class LtvMaterialDiscovery
```

## Remarks

For each cert in the chain (leaf first): 
 
- CRL Distribution Points (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.13) HTTP URLs are fetched and decoded. 
- Authority Information Access (RFC 5280 §4.2.2.1) OCSP URLs are POSTed an OCSP request (built by `ocspRequestFactory` if supplied; otherwise OCSP is skipped) and the response is decoded.   

 Per-URL failures are tolerated: discovery collects what it can and reports failures via `DiscoveryHooks.OnFetchFailed`.
