# PdfDocumentAsync

**Class** in `Chuvadi.Pdf.Documents` (Documents)

Async-capable entry points for `PdfDocument`.

```csharp
public static class PdfDocumentAsync
```

## Remarks

PDF parsing is inherently random-access (cross-reference table at file tail, indirect objects pointed to by absolute byte offsets) so the underlying `Chuvadi.Pdf.IO.PdfReader` needs a seekable stream. When the input stream is not seekable (e.g. a network response stream in Blazor WebAssembly), the bytes are first buffered into a `MemoryStream`.  

 Cancellation is checked at the buffering boundary. Once parsing begins, it runs to completion synchronously on the calling thread.
